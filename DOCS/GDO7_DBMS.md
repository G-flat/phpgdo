# GDOv7 DBMS

[GDOv7 DBAL](../) are all handcrafted carefully and should be a tad faster than anything you have seen.
In GDOv7 there is not a single way to achieve things... there is *only one single way*.
Currently only [MySQL/MariaDB](https://github.com/gizmore/) is supported, but plans for other DBMS are made.


## GDOv7 DBMS: MySQL/MariaDB


## GDOv7 DBMS: Postgres


## GDOv7 DBMS: SQLite
