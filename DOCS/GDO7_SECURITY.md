# GDOv7 SECURITY

Security is important. GDOv7 does it's best to protect your application.


## GDOv7 SECURITY: PHP

PHP changed a lot the past years and got more secure defaults.
However GDOv7 does a nasty trick.
Every little issue, warning or notice causes the debugger to crash the application with a log entry, an email and a rollback.
User input can only enter the ecosystem if it's validate from their GDT.
404 Pages can optionally cause an email, which is nice to find dead links or spot an attack.
Of course nowadays the web is a much more safe place than back in 2000.
Sane cookie defaults and other measures are of course also in place.
