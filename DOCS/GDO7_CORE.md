# GDOv7 Core: modules and functionality

GDOv7 comes with a slim kernel. Basic things are hopefully done right, like timezones, foreign keys, emoticons, input validation, expression parsing, etc.
GDOv7 is highly modular and quick dirty slim. There is no big asset pipeline, just the F5 toolchain to the max.


## List of GDOv7 core modules

The core (this repository) comes with quite a lot modules, but not all are required and installed.

[Module_Perf](../GDO/Perf), for example.
The performance metric module, which is tiny, is not a core dependency.
