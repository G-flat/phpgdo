# GDOv7 Core: modules and functionality

GDOv7 comes with a slim kernel. Basic things are hopefully done right, like timezones, foreign keys, emoticons, input validation, expression parsing, etc.
GDOv7 is highly modular and quick dirty slim. There is no big asset pipeline, just the F5 toolchain to the max.
