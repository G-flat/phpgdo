# phpgdo

PHP reference implementation of GDO, currently version 7.0.
Write solid applications in a new fresh way from code.
Choose, integrate and mix different libraries easily.
The F5 workflow is still unbeaten.
Great production builds are done on the fly, development mode always integrates the source from *all* libraries.
Read more in the [changelogs](./DOCS/GDO7_CHANGELOG.md), look around, or maybe check out the [previous version](https://github.com/gizmore/gdo6).
